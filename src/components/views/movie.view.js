            By now youâ€™ve probably noticed that as you separate your
            Container and Presentational Components, many of your
            Presentational ones just have a render method.
            In these cases, React now allows the component
            to be written as a single function
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Movie;
